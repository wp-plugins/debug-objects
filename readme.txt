== Description ==
The Plugin Debug Objects provides the user, which has the appropriate rights, normally the administrator, a large number of information. Values and content get displayed at the frontend of the blog, to analyze errors but also to better understand WordPress.

= Important for use =
Add to any URL of the WP-installation the string `?debugobjects=true`, so that list all informations of the plugin below the site in frontend or backend.
You can set the constant `FB_WPDO_GET_DEBUG` to `FALSE` for the permanent diversion of all values.

= The Plugin provides in various tabs information to: =
* PHP
* Memory usage
* Operating System
* Server
* WordPress Version
* Language
* Very extensive definitions of various constants
* Cookie definitions
* File Permissions
* Separate user and usermeta tables
* FTP and SSH definitions
* Query information
* Conditional tags; value of the tag
* Theme information
* Template Information
* Cache content
* Hooks and filters
* Functions, which respond on hooks and filters
* Contents of arrays to hooks and filters
* All defined constants

The plugin can be used with my Plugin [Debug Queries](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/debug-queries/ "Debug Queries") and thus the analysis and optimization of the blog can be used. [Debug Queries](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/debug-queries/ "Debug Queries") will be integrated into the frontend of Debug Objects and is only for users with appropriate rights possible.

The plugin does not filter values and should only be used for information and optimization, I don't recommended to use it on a live blog. For developers it can rapidly deliver data, which is useful in a development environment.
There are no data in the database and there are no settings. Therefore, the installation is pretty simple: Just upload the Plugin in the Plugin directory or use the automatic installation of the backend to install and activate the Plugin. In the footer of the frontend of the blog, you can see the information.

The plugin list all entries on frontend and backend of your install; you can custom this with the follow constants on the php-file in the folder of the plugin
`// Hook on Frontend
define( 'FB_WPDO_FRONTEND', TRUE );`
`// Hook on Backend
define( 'FB_WPDO_BACKEND', TRUE );`
